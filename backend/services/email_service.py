"""Sends team access-code emails via Resend (https://resend.com).

Uses Resend's plain HTTPS REST API rather than SMTP. This matters because the
backend is hosted on a Hugging Face Space, and HF Spaces containers commonly
block outbound SMTP ports (25/465/587) at the network level -- Gmail SMTP can
hang or silently fail there with no clear error. A plain HTTPS POST is not
affected by that restriction.

Configuration (env vars):
  RESEND_API_KEY   - required to actually send. If unset, emails are skipped
                      and logged, but team creation still succeeds -- the
                      organizer can always copy the access code manually from
                      the admin Teams tab as a fallback.
  RESEND_FROM      - "from" address, e.g. "Bias Data Event <onboarding@yourdomain.com>".
                      Defaults to Resend's shared sandbox sender, which only
                      delivers to the Resend account owner's own verified
                      email -- fine for local testing, NOT for the real event.
                      Verify your own sending domain in Resend before the
                      event and set this to an address on that domain.
